                Hi, my name is Michael and I’m a software engineer and web application developer. 
                I am a graduate of Rithm School's full stack development bootcamp, and prior to that 
                I worked as a musical instrument repair technician. While my background is hands-on 
                technical (lots of tools and fire), I find it crosses over well and is quite compatible
                with the skills required in this space.
            </p>
            <p className='AboutDisplay-content'>
                I am committed to learning and growing these skills in hopes of making a positive impact 
                in the world. Ultimately, I want to build products that solve real world problems and improve 
                people’s lives. I’m not quite certain what that 
                will look like on this journey, but I’m excited to find out!
            </p>
            <p className='AboutDisplay-content'>
                While not at the keyboard, you can usually find me engaged in one of my numerous hobbies. 
                I enjoy 3d printing, origami, playing music, wood turning at the lathe, and occasionally 
                doing a bit of stand-up improv.
            </p>
